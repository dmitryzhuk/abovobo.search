Cloud Atlas is a 2012 German[8] drama and science fiction film[9] written, 
produced and directed by The Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer. Adapted from the 2004 
novel Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell, the film features multiple plotlines set across six different eras. 
The official synopsis describes it as: "An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one 
another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of 
kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution."[10]

During four years of development, the project met difficulties securing financial support; 
it was eventually produced with a $102 million budget provided by independent sources, making 
it one of the most expensive independent films of all time. Production began in September 2011 
at Studio Babelsberg in Potsdam-Babelsberg, Germany.
